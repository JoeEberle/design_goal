2. **ACCESSIBILITY** - The ability for authorized users to easily access and use the solution from anywhere.
3. **MAINTAINABILITY** - The ability to easily manage and update the solution.
4. **SECURITY** - To secure the solution and data is only available to those who have appropriate access.
5. **RELIABILITY** - The solution works consistently and can be counted on from a business perspective and performs as expected.
6. **PERFORMANT** - The solution performs quickly enough to meet the business demand.
7. **INTELLIGENT** - The solution learns or provides new insights.
8. **CONSISTENCY** - Consistency means having solution work reliably and in the same manner every time.
9. **SELF-DOCUMENTING** - The solution should be able to produce its own documentation.
10. **SELF-TESTING** - Each component of the solution should be able to perform its own unit test.
11. **TALKING** - The solution should be smart enough to explain itself to a non-technical human.
12. **SIMPLE** - The solution should be lean and choose the simplest method of achievement.
13. **PYTHONIC** - If the solution is built in python it is built using the python way.
14. **NO CODE-LOW CODE** - The solution should contain the minimal code or no code required to achieve objective.
